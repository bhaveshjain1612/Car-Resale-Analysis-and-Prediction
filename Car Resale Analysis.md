# **Overview**
The core aim of this project is to derive insights from raw data pertaining to the **resale value** of cars in India. Further, on the basis of these insights, predictive analysis has been done to predict the value of a new entrant into the data, i.e., a car brought for sale.

The project has been done on **Python** using the **Jupyter Notebook IDE** in **IBM Watson Studio**. The dashboarding part is done on **IBM Cognos**.

The domains worked with over here are: 

- Data Wrangling
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning

Libraries used in this project are: 

- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit\_learn
- project
- tabulate


# **Introduction**
## **What?**
The problem is to create an **analytics dashboard** for an easy and visual explanation of data. This is followed by the problem of the creation of a **predictive model** to predict the value a car brought for sale on the basis of the parameters mentioned during visualization.
## **Who?**
The primary target audience for the outcome of this study comprises **second** and **third-hand car dealers** who do not have access to the high-priced services that are charged by experienced industry analysts. This is also meant to aid **new entrants** to the market and **car companies** too.
## **How?**
### Existing Car Dealers
They have been in the industry for a while but are often blindsided whenever someone brings a car to them they havenâ€™t sold earlier. In such a case they may be required to consult analysts to see what is the market share of the ca and so on.
