## Overview
The Project revolves around working with unclean data of automobile resale in India to draw meaningful insights and create a resale value predictor.<br>
The domains worked with over here are :- <br> 
 - **Data Wrangling** to clean the raw data.
 - **Data Analysis** to draw insights from the cleaned data.
 - **Machine Learning** to create the prediction model.
 
## Problem Introduction
**What**<br>
The problem is to create a prediction model and analysis dashboard.<br>
**Who**<br>
The primary target auadience are the second and third hand car dealers working individually or are new entrants in the market.<br>
**Why**<br>
The new entrants and smaller dealers often do not have access to market data or high end mechanics. I aim to simplify their decision making on what car to buy for resale and waht price by looking at the market composition and predicted price.
