## Overview
The Project revolves around working with unclean data of automobile resale in India to draw meaningful insights and create a resale value predictor.<br>
The domains worked with over here are :- <br> 
 - **Data Wrangling** to clean the raw data.
 - **Data Analysis** to draw insights from the cleaned data.
 - **Machine Learning** to create the prediction model.
 
## Problem Introduction
### What?
>The problem is to create a prediction model and analysis dashboard.<br>
### Who? 
>The primary target auadience are the second and third hand car dealers working individually or are new entrants in the market.<br>
### Why?
>The new entrants and smaller dealers often do not have access to market data or high end mechanics. I aim to simplify their decision making on what car to buy for resale and waht price by looking at the market composition and predicted price.

## Methodology
<details>
<summary>Step 1 - Data Cleaning</summary>
The Unclean raw data is cleaned and exported as new sheet to be used later<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Step 2 - Data Analysis</summary>
Looking at the composition of the data nd various statistical measure for the same.<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Step 3 - Data Visualisation</summary>
Finding patterns and relationships between various variables using plots and charts<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Step 4 - Dashboarding</summary>
Creation of an interactive dashboard using IBM cognos to provide insights and visualisations on the go.<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Step 5 - Predictive Modelling</summary>
Using machine learning to create a resale price prediction model<br>
